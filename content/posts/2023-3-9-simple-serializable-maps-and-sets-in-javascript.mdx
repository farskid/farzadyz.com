JavaScript `Map` and `Set` data structures are not serializable by default. It means they can
not be converted to JSON by using `JSON.stringify` on them out of the box.

If we take a look at a simple example:

```js
const map = new Map();
map.set("foo", "bar");

console.log(JSON.stringify(map));
// => {}
```

Despite the fact that `map` is not an empty object, it is serialized to an empty object.

However, serializing maps by extending their built-in class can be done by a few lines of code.

## Map

```js
class SerializableMap extends Map {
  constructor()
  toJSON() {
    return Object.fromEntries(this);
  }
}
```

Now, we can use `SerializableMap` instead of `Map` and it will be serialized to JSON.

```js
const map = new SerializableMap();
map.set("foo", "bar");

console.log(JSON.stringify(map));
// => {"foo":"bar"}
```

## Sets

Similar issue is present on `Set`s. We can take the same approach and make sets serializable as well.

```js
class SerializableSet extends Set {
  toJSON() {
    return Array.from(this);
  }
}
```

And an example would be:

```js
const set = new SerializableSet();
set.add("foo");
set.add("bar");

console.log(JSON.stringify(set));
// => ["foo","bar"]
```

## Conclusion

The above approach works as long as we use `SerializableMap` and `SerializableSet` instead of `Map` and `Set`. Some might take it to the next level and globally replace `Map` and `Set` with their respective serializable classes so every `new Map()` or `new Set()` automatically becomes serializable.

<Warning>Warning: Use at your own risk!</Warning>

```js
Map = SerializableMap;
Set = SerializableSet;
```

Monkey patching standard data structures isn't generally a good idea for the reasons you can look up on the web, but addition only overrides such as `toJSON` on top of the built-in `toJSON` that is simply a no-op looks truly harmless.
