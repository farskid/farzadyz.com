`fetch` is a convenient promise-based web API that lets you communicate with other resources through the network.

Fetch is promise-based meaning that calling it as a function will return a promise to you. Fetch's interface is intuitive, flexible, and well thought out. However, in its simplicity, fetch lacks some of the features required for certain API call patterns found in a typical web application.

Some examples where fetch falls short are cancelling already dispatched network requests, and manually setting the timeout length of a request.Therefore you'll need to bake these additional functionalities into `fetch`. Here is how you can do it:

## Add cancelation support

There is experimental [AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) and [AbortSignal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) support in browsers that allows for signaling the cancellation of an action. If `AbortController` is used for controlling an action, you can get a signal from that controller, pass it to the action, and later abort the controller resulting in canceling the action.

### Use `AbortController` to cancel requests sent by `fetch`

```js
const ctrl = new AbortController();
const fetchData = () =>
  fetch("https://example.com", {
    signal: ctrl.signal,
  });

// When you want to cancel it
ctrl.abort(); // This will also cancel the `fetchData` request
```

From [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController),

> **Note**: When `abort()` is called, the `fetch()` promise rejects with a `DOMException` named `AbortError`.

For convenience purposes and to hide the details of how the cancelation is implemented _(Maybe you change the mechanics later)_, you could also create a factory to have access to both the request promise and the signal to cancel it without having to manage any extra variables.

```js
function createFetchRequest() {
  const ctrl = new AbortController();
  const { signal } = ctrl;
  return {
    request: (url) =>
      fetch(url, {
        signal,
      }),
    cancel() {
      ctrl.abort();
    },
  };
}
const fetcher = createFetchRequest();
// Send the request
fetcher.request("https://example.com");

// Cancel at any time
fetcher.cancel();
```

## Support custom timeouts

There are 2 ways to add timeout functionality to our `fetch` request example from above. One way is to use `Promise.race` and use a fake promise rejection after your desired timeout to reject the fetch request _(thanks to `Promise.race`)_.Another solution is using `setTimeout`. Let's see samples for both approaches.

### Using `Promise.race` to timeout `fetch` requests

```js
/*
@param {number} [seconds] - Duration after which the request will time out
*/
function delay(seconds) {
  return new Promise((_, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      reject(Error("Timed Out"));
    }, seconds * 1000);
  });
}
function createFetchRequest(timeout = 10) {
  const ctrl = new AbortController();
  const { signal } = ctrl;
  return {
    request: (url) =>
      Promise.race([
        delay(timeout).catch(() => {
          ctrl.abort();
        }),
        fetch(url, {
          signal,
        }),
      ]),
    cancel() {
      ctrl.abort();
    },
  };
}
```

Because of the way `Promise.race` works, if the fetch request takes longer than the defined timeout _(default: 10 seconds)_, the timeout will trigger its `Promise.reject` call and reject the promise returned from **createFetchRequest** with a timeout error.

> **Note:** In the approach above, when `Promise.race` rejects due to configured timeout, fetch request won’t be automatically cancelled, therefore, we MUST chain `.catch(() => {ctrl.abort()}),` to `delay(timeout)` to make sure the accompanied network requests gets cancelled.

### Using `setTimeout` to add timeouts to `fetch`

In an approach similar to the previous example, we will use timers to specify when a Promise should be rejected. However, in this example, we will use the `AbortController` instance to signal the cancelling of the request instead of triggering a Promise rejection.

```js
function createFetchRequest(timeoutSeconds = 10) {
  const ctrl = new AbortController();
  const { signal } = ctrl;
  let timer;
  return {
    request: (url) => {
      timer = setTimeout(() => {
        ctrl.abort();
      }, timeoutSeconds * 1000);
      return fetch(url, {
        signal,
      });
    },
    cancel() {
      ctrl.abort();
    },
  };
}
```

Both approaches get the job done, but there is a catch with the 2nd approach:

> The `setTimeout` inside the `timer` variable needs to be cleared if the fetch request responds faster than the defined time!

Be careful with the callbacks passed to `setTimeout`. They will still be executed if their wrapping promise construct is settled.

To take a detour here and to just show you what I mean, look at the order of logs from the example below:

```js
new Promise(resolve => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    reject();
  }, 1000)
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('timeout ran!');
  }, 2000);
}).then(() => {
  console.log('promise resolved')
});

promise resolved
timeout ran!
```

The promise will resolve after 1 second and even though the promise is settled, the setTimeout callback will still run after 2 seconds and log `timeout ran!` to the console.

Getting back to our topic again, we didn't need to clean anything up with approach 1 in which we used `Promise.race` because in that example and inside `setTimeout`, we're only rejecting the promise. When a fetch request comes faster than the configured timeout, `Promise.race` will be fulfilled so the rejection inside the timeout won't have any effects.

## Clean up the timer in case the fetch request responds faster than the configured timeout

Say you have sent a network request with timeout configured to 20 seconds and the request comes back in 8 seconds. The promise returned from the fetch request will resolve but the timers with `setTimeout` are still registered and their callback will be executed when the time arrives! So we need to make sure we clean up the timers when the request is faster than the timeout.

```js
function createFetchRequest(timeoutSeconds = 10) {
  const ctrl = new AbortController();
  const { signal } = ctrl;
  let timer;
  return {
    request: (url) => {
      timer = setTimeout(() => {
        ctrl.abort();
      }, timeoutSeconds * 1000);
      return fetch(url, {
        signal,
      }).then((response) => {
        // clear to avoid abort to be called after the request came back successfully
        clearTimeout(timer);
        // return the response for the rest of the promise chain
        return response;
      });
    },
    cancel() {
      ctrl.abort();
    },
  };
}
```

Clearing the timeout when fetch comes back successfully prevents the timer’s callback from executing when the request is settled. To make sure that consequent `.then`s on the request method will have access to the response from our `fetch` call, we need to return it from our function that clears the timeout. .

## Error handling

There might be cases in which you'd like to handle timeouts or cancelation errors separately than other network errors. Maybe you have a global error handler that shows an alert and you don't want the users to be alerted when the request timed out or is canceled on purpose.

To distinguish timeouts and cancelations from other types of errors, we can write a small utility function.

```js
function isTimedout(error) {
  return error.message === "Timed Out";
}

function isCanceled(error) {
  return error instanceof AbortError;
}
```

If you want to take it to the next level or if you're concerned about the pitfalls of checking against the error message (i18n, etc), you can create a custom error construct and reject an instance of it when timed out.

```js
// Extends the Error constructor
class TimeoutError extends Error {
  constructor(message) {
    this.message = message;
  }
}

// Use custom error in rejection
function timeout(seconds) {
  return new Promise((_, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      reject(TimeoutError("Timed Out"));
    }, seconds * 1000);
  });
}

// Check against that custom error type
function isTimedout(error) {
  return error instanceof TimeoutError;
}
```

## Summary

We learned that being able to set custom timeouts to a request with `fetch` or being able to cancel it on demand could be useful in some cases in our development.
With mindful cancelation, you could save significant resource costs for users on limited metered connections, on mobile devices, or any user that simply doesn't need the chunk of data you're requesting. I'm sure there are plenty of modals out there that request some data but still keep it alive even after the modal is closed immediately and you can probably come up with even more examples from your own applications where canceling a request would be useful.

Gathering all the code we saw through the course of this post, here is a somewhat supercharged fetch that supports both timeouts and cancelation and also has a few utilities to detect the special error types.

```js
/*
@param {number} [seconds] - Duration after which the request will time out
*/
class TimeoutError extends Error {
  constructor(message) {
    this.message = message;
  }
}
function delay(seconds) {
  return new Promise((_, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {reject(TimeoutError('Timed Out'))}, seconds * 1000);
  })
}
// Common methods to put in the prototype object
const requestPrototype = {
  isTimedout(err) {
    return error instanceof TimeoutError;
  },
  isCanceled(err) {
    return error instanceof AbortError;
  }
}
function extends(proto, obj) {
  return Object.assign({}, proto, obj);
}
function Request(timeout = 10) {
  const ctrl = new AbortController();
  const {signal} = ctrl;
  return extends(requestPrototype, {
    request: (url) => Promise.race([
    delay(timeout).catch(() => {ctrl.abort()}),
    fetch(url, {
      signal
    })
    ]),
    cancel() {
      ctrl.abort();
    }
  })
}


// create a fetcher with 20seconds timeout
const fetcher = Request(20);
// send the request
fetcher.request('https://example.com')
  .then(response => {})
  .catch(err => {
    if (fetcher.isTimedout(err)) {}
    if (fetcher.isCanceled(err)) {}
  })

// cancel it on demand
fetcher.cancel();
```
