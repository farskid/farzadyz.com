[Read about `Extract` on the official Typescript docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#extracttype-union).

When dealing with union types in Typescript, sometime you want to pick a member of that union type based one of its properties.

Say you have a union type for all the possible events you can send to an application, let's call it `AppEvent`.

```ts
type AppEvent =
  | { type: "Add_Item"; item: Item }
  | { type: "Edit_Item"; id: string; updates: Partial<Item> };
```

And later you want to write a small function that needs to do something on a particular app event. If there was a way to pass the entire event to the function and borrowing its type from the predeclared **AppEvent** type, it'd save you some maintaining time later on.

```ts
function doSometingAboutEdit(editEvent: unknown) {
  // blah blah
}
```

The way to borrow the typings of `"Edit_Item"` event from `AppEvent` is to use the recently introduced utility called `Extract`. Extract let's you query for members of a union type based on a property type.

Using `Extract`, you can easily type the `editEvent` parameter as:

```ts
function doSometingAboutEdit(
  editEvent: Extract<AppEvent, { type: "Edit_Item" }>
) {
  // blah blah
}
```

The great thing about the `Extract` is that it will give you the typing of that entire event object. Look at the type of object in the screenshot below:

![parameter editEvent is of type object where its key is Edit_Item, its id is a string and its updates is partial of any](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8332043/153709890-c0bc4443-9704-4544-901f-2f6c2e7ca869.png)

[Here is a link to the Typescript playground to see the above code in action](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?jsx=0#code/C4TwDgpgBAksEFsoF4oEMB2IDcAoXokUAgmGAKIBuEGwKuUUAPlAN5SEQBcUARMQBMBAfTiJe2KAEt4CHmKQBfBszYdw3PuQEzRsidIE8AzsABOUjAHNJAVzAC08YzwAKaM8CloANgB4FAD4oRTxcADNbDABjLwB7DCgBOIBlOIQIL2tiACM422BtGQAKCB1C6loecgAPczRYv1IKSuAAGjZOHl4i4D1xRUCASjYVRgB6cagcnzQAC2nZudxFIA)

## Querying multiple members

`Extract` will give you a union type of all the original union members who satisfy the test of the query.

From our example above, if we extend `AppEvent` to more members, we can see our little query gives back all the members who pass the test.

```ts
type AppEvent =
  | { type: "Add_Item"; item: Item }
  | { type: "Edit_Item"; id: string; updates: Partial<Item> }
  | { type: "Delete_Item"; id: string };

type QueryById = Extract<AppEvent, { id: string }>;
/*
| { type: "Edit_Item"; id: string; updates: Partial<Item> }
| { type: "Delete_Item"; id: string };
*/
```

You can think of Extract as `Array.prototype.filter` but for types.

Here is a little code that might help you remember what extract does but don't take this as an accurate comparison.

```ts
const appEvent = [
  { type: "Add_Item", item: {} },
  { type: "Edit_Item", id: "", updates: {} },
  { type: "Delete_Item", id: "" },
];

const queryById = appEvent.filter((event) => event.hasOwnProperty("id"));
/*
[
  { type: "Edit_Item", id: "", updates: {} },
  { type: "Delete_Item", id: "" }
]
*/
```
