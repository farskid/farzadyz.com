      "description": "Rewrote multiple B2C and B2B cloud services (cloud storage, cloud-ware) from Dojo Toolkit to React and Redux. Because of better UX, being responsive for mobile users and increase in performance, our customers grew up to 1 million and 450 thousand. (45% growth). Upgraded a direct HTTP upload service to a Node.js, concurrent, chunk enabled uploader. Since the service is more reliable and supports link resumes, drag and drop and folder upload, our upload instances grew up to almost 20,000 instances per day and decreased the number of tickets complaining about failed uploads, hence caused a better situation for our customer support team. (logs indicate a 60% growth in upload usage). Add testing to projects up to a reasonable code coverage to increase consistency and avoid common mistakes. Before that, the codebase didn’t have any. Brought Git Flow to the dev team that decreased the number of conflicts and increased development speed on the codebase. Gathered a small team of developers to run daily workshops on tech topics such as CI, DevOps, ... to make sure everybody learns as a team. Mentored a junior frontend developer through a solid educational program (which I designed) and prepared them for team projects. Enhanced the CI pipeline to cache none-updated assets that decreased the frontend build duration up to 50%. Integrated upload interface with the native camera to increase UX. Designed and developed an embedding system for cloud-based files. Came up with an ACL system on projects that helped the company to reuse code base and extend its business model from B2C to B2B that eventually led to a 200,000 Euros contract with the main telecommunication service in Iran called Irancell. Rewrote file preview/download service to Node.js server-side rendered pages. A member of the hiring process."
