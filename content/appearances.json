However, since the behaviour of the component is the same, it would be beneficial to find a practical way to share this behaviour between different platforms, styling systems, state containers, data transmitters and any other sort of integrations.In this talk, I'll be showing a set of techniques to model a semi complicated React component, independent from the common integrations.",

Developers, Designers and even product related roles can take something out of this talk.",

    "description": "The user interface is challenging to the core. There are many UI components that carry a huge deal of complexity. Usually, we deal with complexity in UI without noticing it. As truly said, the devil is in the detail. We usually don't notice this until it's too late! That's why no matter how clean our UI and their API surface looks when the first attempt is out, many bugs pop out soon and adding new features gives us a hard time! As animals, we might not have a great tool (sarcasm towards our own brain) to think, consider and compute. we tend to forget. we can't consider everything. we are unable to foresee and predict software. we carry assumptions that aren't correct all the time. This might be a reason why our software starts as an explicit, great looking codebase until the moment reaches when this so-called software transitions from evergreen to ever failing and legacy. By thinking about the history of UI development and trying to explore different complexities, we might be able to find better ways to develop UI.",

We usually don't notice this until it's too late! That's why no matter how clean our components and their API surface looks when the first attempt is out, many bugs pop out soon and adding new features gives us a hard time! In this talk, I will try to demonstrate how we underestimate the complexity in React UI components and propose an approach to simplify this effort by modeling the behavior of the component using Reactive Statecharts. I'll go through the thinking model of how to tackle this complexity in developing the component, how to think properly about the edge cases and how to model this explicitly using Reactive Statecharts.",

    "description": "There are many reasons why developing user interface is hard. No matter which platform we target or the way we present our UI, the user interface is hard to develop due to different reasons. One of the hardest problems of UI development that has been shining more and more in recent years is the state management. In this talk, Farzad will show how using current tooling isn't the complete solution and how our current approaches lack a whole modeling layer in between and what are the most critical mistakes we make in modeling our user interfaces these days. He will demonstrate how this modeling problem can be enhanced using state machines and statecharts in particular.",

    "description": "This is a talk about how client side application's state is inherently relational and hierarchical. Current tooling in JS state management allows for flat model states and global actions availability which results in an increase in cyclomatic complexity. The flat shape of state also brings its own set of integration problems. these issues could be tackled using a modeling language that considers this relation, gives lifecycle to the parts of state and invalidates automatically, is deterministic and whitelists allowed transitions instead of blacklisting on runtime guards.
