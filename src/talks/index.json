    "description": "Often when we need to develop user interfaces, we model the interface behaviour based on a visual design or the platform we ship onto. However, since the behaviour of the component is the same, it would be beneficial to find a practical way to share this behaviour between different platforms, styling systems, state containers, data transmitters and any other sort of integrations.In this talk, I'll be showing a set of techniques to model a semi complicated React component, independent from the common integrations.",
