### Test meta tags and Open Graph locally

1. Run the development server to spawn a local server on port 3000:<br/>
   `$ yarn dev`
2. In another terminal tab, run `yarn test:meta` to spawn an instance of localtunnel listening to the same port as the development server:<br/>
   `$ yarn test:meta`
3. The localtunnel process will show a URL in the terminal for a temporary deployment of the development server:
   `your url is: https://exampleurl.com`
4. Use this URL with the social media platforms (or any other platform using [Open Graph](https://ogp.me)) below to test how they’d preview the home page or any post page meta information:

- [Twitter card validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)
- [LinkedIn post inspector](https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/)
- [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) (requires Facebook login)
